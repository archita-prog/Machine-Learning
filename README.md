# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Essentials â€” From Basics to Models

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Repository**!  
This project is a structured collection of notebooks and scripts that demonstrate the **core ML algorithms and preprocessing techniques** â€” from data handling using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** to predictive modeling with **Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and more**.

Each folder includes:
- ðŸ“˜ Well-documented Python code  
- ðŸ“Š Step-by-step implementation  
- ðŸ§  Intuitive explanations and mathematical intuition
